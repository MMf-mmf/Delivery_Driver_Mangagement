# Delivery Management App

This app is designed for delivery drivers and administrators to manage package pickups and deliveries. The app allows administrators to add customers to a daily route and schedule the time of pickup, as well as find the quickest route for the driver to take. Drivers can then view their route on the app and take a picture of the packages picked up from the customer as proof of pickup and mark it as complete. The administrator can track the driver's location in real-time using GPS mapping.
